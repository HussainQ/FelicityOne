!!! note warning "Parallel Program"
    We are aware of a lot of people trying to exploit their way into receiving this emblem.<br>

    Felicity team does **NOT** authorize any use of our work nor participation in our team to acquire this emblem.<br><br>
    If you are a community manager coming to check out this site because someone asked for the emblem after helping us, please disregard.<br>
